## Overview

This project consists of an IoT device and sensor simulator, a REST API backend, and a UI for monitoring real-time updates. The system is containerized using **Docker Compose** and provides WebSocket-driven updates to the UI.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Build and Start Services
To bring up `ACME-REST`, `acme-ui`, and `ACME-simulator`:

#### Option A: Attached Mode
- Logs are observable in the current shell.

    <br>Initial build:
    ```sh
    docker compose up --build
    ```

#### Option B: Detached Mode
- Runs in the background, no logs.
    
    <br>Initial build:
    ```sh
    docker compose up --build -d
    ```

#### Rebuild and Start
To reset the DB, without going into `ACME-REST` and undoing-redoing migrations:

Stop all running containers, remove volumes, rebuild, and start the services:
```sh
docker compose down -v && docker compose up --build
```

### Step 2: Open the UI
Open the following URL in your browser:
<br>http://localhost:5173/

#### Monitor WebSocket Events and API Network Calls

To observe UI<->REST communications:

1. **Open DevTools**: Right-click â†’ Inspect â†’ Console tab.
2. **View WebSocket logs** in the **Console**.
3. **Check API calls** under the **Network tab** (filter by XHR).

### Step 3: Use the CLI to Register Devices, Simulate Readings, Delete Devices, Update Sensors

#### Step 3.1: Access acme-simulator 
For Step 1. Option A: Open a new shell and enter the following  
For Step 1. Option B: Enter the following in the current shell

```sh
docker exec -it acme-simulator sh
```

Register devices:

```sh
node cli.js register-devices "car=2,truck=2"
```

ðŸ“Œ **Expected Result**: The UI updates and displays 4 devices in the **Registered Devices** table.

Click on the **first device** in the table and notice that it currently has **no readings**.

#### Step 3.2: Simulate Device Readings

Start sensor data simulation for specific devices:

```sh
node cli.js simulate-readings-for-devices 1,3
```

ðŸ“Œ **Expected Result**:

- The selected device now shows readings under the **Sensor Data** table.
- Clicking on another device (e.g., the 3rd device) also shows real-time sensor updates.

#### Step 3.3: Stop Simulation

To stop the running simulation process, press:

- **Ctrl + C**

#### Step 3.4: Delete Devices

Delete a registered device:

```sh
node cli.js delete-device 4
```

ðŸ“Œ **Expected Result**: The last device is removed from the UI.

#### Step 3.5: Modify Sensors

Update a sensor unit:
- With a fresh db and by following the above commands as they are, with the first row (car with ID 1) selected for which data is being simulated:

```sh
node cli.js update-sensor -i 1 -u "px"
```

ðŸ“Œ **Expected Result**: This will update the camera sensor's unit from pixels to px.

### Shutdown and Delete Containers
```sh
docker compose down -v
```
